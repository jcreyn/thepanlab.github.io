Please feel free to contact us for collaborations. If you are a domain biologist, we can help you apply omics technologies to your system. If you have a large amount of omics data and need help with data analysis using our algorithms, we can provide limited user support. If you develop related algorithms, we can provide test datasets and use and promote your algorithms in our research.
