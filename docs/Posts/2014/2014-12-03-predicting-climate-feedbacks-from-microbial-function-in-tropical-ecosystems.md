# Predicting Climate Feedbacks from Microbial Function in Tropical Ecosystems
In collaboration with Dr. Melanie Mayes at ORNL, we were awarded an LDRD project to improve climate modeling of tropical terrestrial ecosystems using meta-omics analyses of soil communities.

**Summary**:

The soil microbial community exerts significant control over complex ecosystem function. The most ambitious theories suggest that functional traits of a community, e.g., methanogenesis and phosphate scavenging can be used to predict environmental outcomes, e.g., soil nutrient availability and CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. In this pilot study, we will use metagenomics and other measurements to attribute functions to soil microbial communities along a gradient of phosphorus availability in Panama. We will manipulate moisture, temperature, and phosphorus in the lab to effect changes in the metagenome, enzyme activities, and other indicators, thus enabling correlations between community functional profiles and climate feedbacks such as CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4 </sub>emissions. We hypothesize that the balance of methanogens over methanotrophs will be significantly shifted in response to increased moisture, and that metagenomics can identify changes in the functional profiles of a soil community to facilitate predictive modeling of emissions. Adding P and increasing temperature will further increase CO<sub>2 </sub>and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, with greater effects in P-limited versus P-rich gradient soils. We will develop a framework to use correlations from community functional profiles to predict observed ecosystem outcomes in the Community Land Model (CLM). Our work will enable scaling of complex ecosystem functions from genes to functional groups to predict how organisms interact under natural environmental conditions and influence climate.
