#### Procedure:

1: Harvest cells and then rapidly freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen.

Note: To prevent storage tubes or bags from exploding, remove all liquid nitrogen by gently pouring off before closing and do not screw tube lids firmly!

2: Homogenize the frozen cells in liquid nitrogen into a fine powder using a pestle and mortar. Weigh 100 mg of frozen powder in a pre-cooled Eppendorf tube, or 500 mg in the case of larger amounts of biomass in a 10-ml glass tube with screw cap.

Note: Take care that tissues stay well frozen during homogenization; discard any samples that start to thaw. If needed, carefully pour a small volume of liquid nitrogen onto the sample, let the nitrogen evaporate and continue homogenization.

3: Prepare extracts freshly at the beginning of a series of analyses. Add ice-cold sample extraction solution (99.875% methanol acidified with 0.125% FA) in a volume/fresh weight ratio of 3 to the tube containing the weighed frozen powder, close lid and immediately vortex for 10 s. Assuming a cell water content of about 95%, this will result in a final concentration of 75% methanol and 0.1% FA. In the case of samples with highly variable water contents or lyophilized material, pure water can be added to adjust each sample to a final solvent concentration of 75% methanol and 0.1% FA. Store extracts on ice until all samples are ready.

4: Sonicate sample ( 20% Amplitude | 2 m | 10 s on | 10 s off) with sample tube suspended in cool water from faucet to disperse heat.

5: Centrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed (20,000g for Eppendorf tubes; 3,000g for glass tubes) at room temperature.

6: Filter the supernatant through a 0.2-mm PTFE filter using a disposable syringe into a 1.8-ml glass vial and close the vial with cap.

Single-use sterile and non-pyrogenic latex-free syringes, 0.01–1 ml Tuberkulin Omnifix-F (B.Braun Melsungen AG, cat. no. 9161406V)

Single-use syringe filters free of polymers, such as Anotop 10 (diameter 10 mm, pore size 0.2 mm; Whatman, cat. no. 6809-1022) or Minisart RC4 (diameter 4 mm, pore size 0.2 mm; Sartorius, cat. no. 17821). Note: Filters for MS analyses should be resistant to extraction solution (75% methanol + 0.1% FA) and free of polyethylene glycol or any other soluble polymer
