This is a rejected proposal of mine to the Simons Collaboration on Ocean Processes and Ecology (SCOPE) from the Simons Foundation.

**_Project Overview:_**

Metaproteomics allows measurement of relative abundances, post-translational modifications, and stable isotope enrichments of a large number of proteins from natural microbial communities. Here we propose to improve metaproteomics technologies for studying marine communities at Station ALOHA and use these technologies to characterize metaproteome samples generated in the SCOPE program. We will focus on (A) multiplexed quantitative proteomics for surveying a large number of marine samples in a high-throughput manner and (B) proteomic stable isotope probing (SIP) for resolving material exchanges among members of a microbial community. Our capabilities will enable SCOPE investigators to employ metaproteomics, as a standalone technology or as a component of multi -omics assays, to address biological questions and generate ecosystem models.
