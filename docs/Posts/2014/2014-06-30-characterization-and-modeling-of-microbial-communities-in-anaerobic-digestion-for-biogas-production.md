This is an rejected proposal to DOE BER from 2011.

Abstract:

Anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass generates biogas – a mixture of approximately 60% methane and 40% CO<sub>2</sub>. For centuries, AD has been used to treat municipal sludge and organic waste from agriculture and industry. AD is highly effective in sanitizing the waste and removing organic pollutants. As a by-product of AD waste treatment, the biogas is not well utilized in many waste management facilities. Only recently has AD been studied as a bioenergy technology to maximize the production of biogas as a renewal biofuel. Biogas can be used in combined heat and power plants to co-generate electricity and useful heat at up to 90% efficiency with a minimum amount of atmosphere pollution. The heat is usually used for digester heating and general space and water heating. Biogas can also be upgraded to the same standard as fossil natural gas with 98% methane by removing CO<sub>2</sub> and other trace gas contaminants. The upgraded biogas is a CO<sub>2</sub>-neutral and renewal replacement for fossil natural gas. It can be injected into natural gas grids or be used to fuel natural gas vehicles. The purpose of this proposal is to use a suite of high-throughput systems biology methods to characterize a model AD microbial community grown in thermophilic condition with switchgrass as the feedstock. Metabolic processes in AD will be linked to specific members of the community using metaproteomics and <sup>13</sup>C stable isotope probing and the flux rates of these metabolic processes will be measured using <sup>13</sup>C tracing. The results will be integrated to build a computational model of the community’s syntrophic metabolic network. Staff will characterize the response of the metabolic network to perturbations and the evolution of the community metagenomes.
