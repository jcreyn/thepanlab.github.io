I am excited to move to the University of Oklahoma as a tenured Associate Professor. The University of Oklahoma at Norman (OU) is a Carnegie-R1 comprehensive public research university. US News & World Report ranks OU in the top 50 (No. 41) in the &#8220;Top Public Schools – National Universities&#8221; category. Norman is a culturally rich and vibrant town located in the Oklahoma City metro area.

I have a joint appointment at the [School of Computer Science](http://www.ou.edu/coe/cs) in the <span class="st">Gallogly College of Engineering. My main office is located with Computer Science in the new Devon Energy Hall. The office space for my students and postdocs (the dry lab) are adjacent to my office in the Devon Energy Hall. Our computing hardware is housed and supported by the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/oscer">OU Supercomputing Center for Education & Research (OSCER)</a>.</span>

<span class="st">I also have a joint appointment at the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/mpbio/">Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology (MPBio)</a> in the College of Arts and Sciences. I have a wet lab in the George Lynn Cross Hall with MPBio. The wet lab is 10-minute walking distance from the dry lab on the OU main campus. </span>I have access to the [Mass Spectrometry Facility](http://www.ou.edu/cas/chemistry/research/research-support-services/mass-spectrometry) within the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](http://www.ou.edu/cas/chemistry)  in the Stephenson Life Sciences Research Center on the OU Research Campus.

Above these facilities, I appreciate the opportunities to recruit and mentor graduate students in both Computer Science and Biology and to collaborate with faculty members in these departments. My research goal is to build an interdisciplinary bioinformatics research program at OU. We will use the latest technological advances in machine learning, high-performance computing, and other fields of CS to solve biological problems. And we aim to solve high-impact biological problems in environmental biology and human health with an integrated data-driven process from data generation in the wet lab, knowledge discovery in the dry lab, and validation in the wet lab.

My teaching goal is to bring data science education to the Biology and Chemistry students in the College of Arts and Sciences and to bring real-world applications of high-performance computing and machine learning to the Computer Science students in the Gallogly College of Engineering.
