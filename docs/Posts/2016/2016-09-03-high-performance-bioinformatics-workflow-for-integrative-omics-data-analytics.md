# High Performance Bioinformatics Workflow for Integrative ‘-omics’ Data Analytics
Our joint proposal with Dr. Judson Hervey at Naval Research Laboratory and Dr. Mihai Pop at University of Maryland College Park has been funded by the DoD high-performance computing modernization program.

&nbsp;

Summary

The ability of advanced commercial analytical platforms to acquire large-scale biomolecular data, such as genome sequencers and mass spectrometers, has outpaced development of adequate software tools effectively analyze the data.  The technical goal of this work is to prepare a suite of bioinformatics software applications for emerging high-performance computing architectures, specifically focusing on applications for: genome (and metagenome) assembly, protein identification (metaproteome data processing), and protein functional annotation (as inferred by sequence similarity). ).  Scaling these computationally complex processes into a modular suite of bioinformatics applications on supercomputers will provide the DOD with a competitive edge in high performance computing.
