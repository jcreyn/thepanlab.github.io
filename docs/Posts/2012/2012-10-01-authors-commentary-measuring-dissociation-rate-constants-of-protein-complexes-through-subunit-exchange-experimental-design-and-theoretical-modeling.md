Pan, C. Measuring dissociation rate constants of protein complexes through subunit exchange: experimental design and theoretical modeling. _PloS one_ **6**, e28827, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0028827 (2011).

Of all the papers I have written so far, this paper is pretty special. You may notice that I&#8217;m the only author on this paper, which is probably very rare to find in the biomedical field.  Here I want to comment on how this paper came about.

Many years ago, interactomics was a very hot field, because it offered a comprehensive view of the physical interaction network among proteins. ORNL and PNNL had a large project (CMCS, http://mippi.ornl.gov/) as part of the genome-to-life program to map out the protein interaction network in R. palustris by tandem affinity pulldown. I was involved in a small part in the late stage of this project and we were thinking about the next phase. This is basically one idea I came up.

When our project was ended (long story), I finished all the experimental design and theoretical calculation, but we didn&#8217;t have time and funding to do any preliminary experiment. I applied for other funding to support this small idea using only my theoretical calculation in 2008. Obviously, it was not funded. I probably had little chance to get it funded (lack of preliminary results, high risk of establishing a completely new approach, and reduced general interest in interactomics). But I kept thinking that this idea is too interesting to be buried. The system is mathematically elegant, in my opinion. Of course, getting the method to work experimentally will be a huge challenge.

Obviously, I can&#8217;t publish this in traditional journals. But Plos one happened and the philosophy of plos one would accommodate this idea, so I re-packaged my rejected proposal to this paper. I&#8217;m grateful to the editor, Dr. Eugene Permyakov at Russian Academy of Sciences, the anonymous reviewers, and Plos One for allowing me to disseminate this idea in Plos one
