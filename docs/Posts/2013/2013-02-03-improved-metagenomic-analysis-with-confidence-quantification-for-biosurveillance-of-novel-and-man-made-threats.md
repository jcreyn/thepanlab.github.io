Our LDRD proposal to the biosecurity initiative has been funded.

**Abstract**:

Genetically engineered and naturally occurring, novel pathogens are currently blind spots of biosurveillance. Such threats confound or defeat standard biosurveillance techniques based on PCR and immunological assays. This challenge can be addressed by using a metagenomics approach, in which all microorganisms in a field sample are directly sequenced together. The genome of a pathogen, even if it is altered by natural recombination or genetic engineering, can be computationally reconstructed and identified from background microorganisms. The pathogen?s genome provides information on its full malicious capability, evolutionary origin, and genetic manipulation history. Although next-generation sequencing technologies are ready for biosurveillance deployment, the informatics needed to extract information from the vast amount of sequencing data still requires significant improvements in terms of detection accuracy, analysis speed, and information content. The objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated informatics solution for applying metagenomics to accurately detect novel or man-made pathogens and comprehensively characterize their genetic capabilities in a short turnaround time. The key technical innovation of the proposed work is the construction of probabilistic error models of next-generation sequencing data and the quantification of statistical confidence in threat detection and characterization. The proposed informatics solution will be systematically tested and evaluated for different biosurveillance scenarios using real-world and simulated metagenomic data.
