Hypermutator cells in cancer tissues often develop multi-drug resistance. In this new project, we will identify hypermutator cells in cancer tissues using single-cell genomics and characterize their metabolic activities using single-population transcriptomics and proteomics. I will focus on identification of mutations in hypermutators and integration of transcriptomics and proteomics results.
