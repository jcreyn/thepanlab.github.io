In this new project, we will study the microbiota of patients with endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer. Urogenital microbiota, fecal microbiota and peritoneal microbiota will be characterized using genotyping, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. We will identify microbial signatures that can assist early detection and diagnosis of gynecologic cancer pathology. I will focus on the computational processing and statistical analysisÂ  of meta-omics data on the Titan supercomputer using our Omega, Sigma and UniFam algorithms.
