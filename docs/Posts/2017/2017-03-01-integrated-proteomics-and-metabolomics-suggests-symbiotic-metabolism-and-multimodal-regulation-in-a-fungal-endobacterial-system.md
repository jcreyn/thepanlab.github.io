This is a very interesting study done by our lab in collaboration with the Campagna lab at UTK and the PMI project team. From the perspective of -omics technologies, we aimed to better integrate the results from proteomics and metabolomics. Because of our deep coverage of the proteomes and the metabolomes, we were able to find many biochemical reactions in which both the enzymes and the intermediates were quantified. This allowed us to make some inferences using enzymatic kinetics. We found examples of regulations by post-translational modification, allosteric effectors, and abundances changes of the reactants and enzymes.

From the perspective of systems biology on this fungal/endobacterial synbiotic system, the most interesting discovery of ours is the transfer of carbon from fungi to endobacteria via malate.  We found the putative fungi pathway for malate production and the putative endobacterial pathway for malate transportation and malate consumption. This provides specific hypotheses that can be tested in future molecular biology experiments.

Thanks a lot for this nice commentary from Ben Orsburn:
