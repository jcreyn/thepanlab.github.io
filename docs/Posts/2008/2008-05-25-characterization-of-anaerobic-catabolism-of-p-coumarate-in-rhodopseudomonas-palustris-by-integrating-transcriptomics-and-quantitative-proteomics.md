**Abstract:** In this study, the pathway for anaerobic catabolism of p-coumarate by a model bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, was characterized by comparing the gene expression profiles of cultures grown in the presence of p-coumarate, benzoate, or succinate as the sole carbon sources. Gene expression was quantified at the mRNA level with transcriptomics and at the protein level with quantitative proteomics using (15)N metabolic labeling. Protein relative abundances, along with their confidence intervals for statistical significance evaluation, were estimated with the software ProRata. Both -omics measurements were used as the transcriptomics provided near-full genome coverage of gene expression profiles and the quantitative proteomics ascertained abundance changes of over 1600 proteins. The integrated gene expression data are consistent with the hypothesis that p-coumarate is converted to benzoyl-CoA, which is then degraded via a known aromatic ring reduction pathway. For the metabolism of p-coumarate to benzoyl-CoA, two alternative routes, a beta-oxidation route and a non-beta-oxidation route, are possible. The integrated gene expression data provided strong support for the non-beta-oxidation route in R. palustris. A putative gene was proposed for every step in the non-beta-oxidation route.
