Procedure for extracting proteome samples from plant tissues:

  1. Place a pestle into a mortar and then pour liquid N into the mortar to pre-chill the mortar and pestle.[<img class="aligncenter wp-image-1051 size-thumbnail" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2249-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2249.jpg)
  2. After liquid N has evaporated, add 1 g of plant tissue into the mortar.[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1052 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2250-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2250.jpg)
  3. Pour liquid N into the mortar. After liquid N has evaporated, start grinding.[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1054 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2252-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2252.jpg)[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1055 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2253-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2253.jpg)[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1056 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2254-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2254.jpg)
  4. Repeat the step 3 twice. The plant tissue should be turned into powers. If not, repeat the step 3 until the sample is turned into powders.[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1057 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2255-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2255.jpg)
  5. Transfer the sample into a 15-ml falcon tube and then add 1 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer (4% w/v SDS in 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0).[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1060 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2258-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2258.jpg)
  6. Vortex the sample tube to mix the plant tissue with the SDS lysis buffer.
  7. Place sample in 95˚C heat block for 5~10 min.[<img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1061 aligncenter" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2263-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_2263.jpg)
  8. Sonicate the sample (20% Amplitude | 2 m | 10 s on | 10 s off) with sample tube suspended in cool water from faucet to disperse heat.
  9. Place the sample in 95˚C heat block for an additional 5~10 min.
 10. Centrifuge the sample at 4500 x g for 5 min.
 11. Transfer the supernatant to a clean 2-ml tube and then add trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to the final concentration of 20%. Invert the tube briefly and place it at 4˚C for overnight.
 12. Centrifuge TCA precipitated sample at 21000 x g / 4˚C for 5 min.
 13. Discard supernatant appropriately (hazardous waste), taking care not to disrupt the pelleted protein.
 14. Add 1 ml of cold acetone to sample to wash the pellet.
 15. Centrifuge sample at 21000 x g / 4˚C for 5 min. Remove as much residual acetone as possible leaving the protein pellet in the tube.
 16. Repeat steps 13 – 14 twice.
 17. Place samples in fume hood with cap open to evaporate most of the residual acetone.
 18. Add 200 ul of 6M guanidine to re-suspend the protein pellet and incubate the sample at 60˚C for 30 min.
 19. Perform BCA assay to determine protein concentration using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit.
 20. 100 ug of protein is sufficient for shotgun proteomics. Less quantity of protein can be tried.
