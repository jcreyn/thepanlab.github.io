We were awarded a project to reconstruct haploid-resolved genomes using hybrid sequencing.

**Project Description** 

Construction of a reference genome is the first step of studying the genomics of complex eukaryotic diploid organisms. Poplar and human are two representative examples of such organisms. The two haploid genomes found in individual poplars and humans differ from each other and from their respective reference genomes by small local variations and large structural variations. Illumina sequencing has allowed the identification of local variations of an individual genome relative to the reference genome. However, to find the genetic basis of a phenotype, one also needs to identify structural differences in the paternal and maternal haploids, which cannot be achieved using the existing methods. Here, we propose to develop a new approach to bridge this critical technology gap and demonstrate its feasibility on both a poplar and a human test case. In this approach, we will combine Illumina sequencing with PacBio sequencing and develop new algorithms to analyze such hybrid sequencing data. We will generate fully resolved haploid genomes for a poplar and a human and determine their parental-origin-specific local and structural variations. This approach, when scaled to a population, will allow more accurate and comprehensive identification of genome variations linked to important phenotypes in poplars and humans.
