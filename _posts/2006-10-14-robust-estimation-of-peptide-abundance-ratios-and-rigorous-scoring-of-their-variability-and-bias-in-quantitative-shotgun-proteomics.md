**Abstract:** The abundance ratio between the light and heavy isotopologues of an isotopically labeled peptide can be estimated from their selected ion chromatograms. However, quantitative shotgun proteomics measurements yield selected ion chromatograms at highly variable signal-to-noise ratios for tens of thousands of peptides. This challenge calls for algorithms that not only robustly estimate the abundance ratios of different peptides but also rigorously score each abundance ratio for the expected estimation bias and variability. Scoring of the abundance ratios, much like scoring of sequence assignment for tandem mass spectra by peptide identification algorithms, enables filtering of unreliable peptide quantification and use of formal statistical inference in the subsequent protein abundance ratio estimation. In this study, a parallel paired covariance algorithm is used for robust peak detection in selected ion chromatograms. A peak profile is generated for each peptide, which is a scatterplot of ion intensities measured for the two isotopologues within their chromatographic peaks. Principal component analysis of the peak profile is proposed to estimate the peptide abundance ratio and to score the estimation with the signal-to-noise ratio of the peak profile (profile signal-to-noise ratio). We demonstrate that the profile signal-to-noise ratio is inversely correlated with the variability and bias of peptide abundance ratio estimation.
