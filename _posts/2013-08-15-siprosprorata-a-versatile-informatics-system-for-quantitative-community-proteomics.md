**Abstract:** SUMMARY: Sipros/ProRata is an open-source software package for end-to-end data analysis in a wide variety of community proteomics measurements. A database-searching program, Sipros 3.0, was developed for accurate general-purpose protein identification and broad-range post-translational modification searches. Hybrid Message Passing Interface/OpenMP parallelism of the new Sipros architecture allowed its computation to be scalable from desktops to supercomputers. The upgraded ProRata 3.0 performs label-free quantification and isobaric chemical labeling quantification in addition to metabolic labeling quantification. Sipros/ProRata is a versatile informatics system that enables identification and quantification of proteins and their variants in many types of community proteomics studies. AVAILABILITY: Both programs are freely available under the GNU GPL license at Sipros.omicsbio.org and ProRata.omicsbio.org.
