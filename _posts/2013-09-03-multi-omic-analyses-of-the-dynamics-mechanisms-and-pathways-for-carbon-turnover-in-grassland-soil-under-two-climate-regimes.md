Our joint proposal with Dr. Jill Banfield at UC Berkeley has been awarded in the DOE BER program of &#8220;Systems Biology–Enabled Research on the Roles of Microbial Communities in Carbon Cycling&#8221;.

**Summary**:

The goal of this project is to investigate how altered rainfall impacts carbon stored in grassland soil by characterizing effects on microbially mediated carbon decomposition and nitrogen cycle processes. The project will use genome-targeted metagenomics, stable isotope–resolved metaproteomics, and community metabolomic analyses. The study will leverage a longterm ecological research site in California that features an ongoing experimental manipulation of water inputs to mimic shifting precipitation regimes relevant to climate change scenarios. New data visualization tools will be developed for the DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase to facilitate integration of the information generated in the study and scaling of data to higher-order process understanding.
