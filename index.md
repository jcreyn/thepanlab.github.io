We conduct [research projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/projects.md %}) in the areas of machine learning, microbiology, bioinformatics, biomedical data science, and parallel computing. Our research products include [scientific publications]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/publications.md %}), [computer software]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/software.md %}), and [machine learning models]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/software.md %}). Please see our [physical labs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/space.md %}) and our [computing resources]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/computing.md %}).
