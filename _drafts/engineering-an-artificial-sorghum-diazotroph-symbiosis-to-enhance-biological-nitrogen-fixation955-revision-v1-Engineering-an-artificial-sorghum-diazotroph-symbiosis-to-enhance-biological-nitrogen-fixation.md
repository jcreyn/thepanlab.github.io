This is a joint proposal of ours with Joel Griffitts at Brigham Young Univ., Thomas Clemente at Univ. of Nebraska, Lincoln, Yves Dessaux at Institute of Integrative Cell Biology, and Jay Chen at ORNL. It was submitted a FOA from DOE BER: &#8220;Biosystems Design to Enable Next-Generation Biofuels and Bioproducts&#8221;.

Natural plant microbiomes play very important roles in acquiring nutrients for plants and protecting plants from diseases. Many plants, including sorghum, host diazotrophs in their endosphere and trade carbon for fixed nitrogen with the diazotrophs. We asked the question how we can use synthetic biology to enhance this mutually beneficially relationship. Suppose that we engineer a diazotroph to fix more nitrogen to benefit the plant host. But this diazotroph with the extra burden of nitrogen fixation would have no chance outcompeting other microorganisms in natural plant endosphere communities. So, the logic solution is to help this engineered diazotroph with an exclusive carbon source from the plant. The plant can be engineered to over-produce many substrates in its endosphere, but these additional carbon substrates would be available for all endophytes and, thus, do not help our engineered diazotroph specifically. Our solution to this problem is inspired by a natural plant engineer,Â _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_. It can genetically modify a plant to produce opines that is difficult to consume by other soil microorganisms. Here we would engineer the plant to produce an opine and an diazotroph to consume the opine and fix nitrogen.

I think this is a very clever idea and we had a great team. Joel is an expert on diazotrophs and plant endophytes and he brought up this idea first in our brainstorming sessions, Yves has done many pioneering experiments with the opine metabolism, Tom is well known for sorghum engineering, Jay is a plant biologist with a lot of experience studying plant-microbe interactions, and I have expertise with using systems biology to help the design and evaluation of synthetic biology experiments.

Unfortunately, it was not funded.
