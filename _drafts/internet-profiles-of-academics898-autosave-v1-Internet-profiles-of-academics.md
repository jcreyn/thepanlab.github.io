I started to update my online profiles. I want to briefly summarize my experience here.

#### Lab website

This main website is basically a WordPress website. This allows us to add more diverse types of contents in formats that we choose. We also created subdomains to release new software.

#### Google Scholar

The advantage of Google Scholar is that it doesn&#8217;t require much maintenance. Once one creates a Google Scholar profile, it will automatically add new publications and keep track of their citation. Google has been able to update my publications very accurately (no false positive or false negative). I heard that the citation data here is not as accurate as Web of Science, but it&#8217;s probably good enough in exchange for convenience.

#### ORCID

Many journals now require authors to provide this. I also created a profile here. It&#8217;s difficult to update the publication list. I imported my publications from ResearcherID below.

#### ResearcherID

This is owned byÂ Thomson Reuters. It has good integration with Web of Science and EndNote. The researchers have to manually update their publication lists. I mainly use it to keep a record of my publications and export them to ORCID.

#### Twitter

Many labs and researchers are now on Twitter to release news. Twitter appears to be more popular than Facebook for this purpose. I recently created a Twitter account. The signal-to-noise ratio is pretty low in my feed. It seems that one needs to tweet frequently to be noticed. I don&#8217;t know how much time I&#8217;ll have for this.

#### Organization profiles

I have personal profiles at ORNL and UTK. They show my official affiliation with the two institutes. But my profiles there don&#8217;t get updated frequently.

#### Github

This is probably important for open-source software developers. I have some repositories for the software developed in our lab, but I haven&#8217;t done a good job of updating them. I typically ask my lab members to manage all their codes in their personal Github repo. This gives them more exposure to their work.

#### LinkedIn

I think this is basically a CV database for the industry. I don&#8217;t know how widely it is used in academia. I haven&#8217;t created a profile there yet.

#### ResearchGate and Frontiersin Loop

This is another social media for academia. I got a lot of spam emails from them to join a few years ago, so I did not join to avoid more spams. I don&#8217;t know what its niche is.

#### 

This is another social media created by the Frontier journals. They seemed to create profiles automatically for their authors. Since I don&#8217;t want to maintain yet another profile, I turned my profile to private.
