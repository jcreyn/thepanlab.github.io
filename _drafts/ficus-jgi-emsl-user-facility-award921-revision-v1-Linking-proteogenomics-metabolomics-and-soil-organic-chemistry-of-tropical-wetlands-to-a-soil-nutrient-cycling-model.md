This user proposal from Melanie Mayes and us has been selected by JGI and EMSL in [the FICUS user program](https://jgi.doe.gov/user-program-info/community-science-program/how-to-propose-a-csp-project/emsl/). Tropical ecosystems are very vulnerable to environmental perturbations from land use changes and climate changes. In order to model the responses of a tropical ecosystem to these future changes, we need to have a better understanding of the nutrient cycling by the communities in tropical soils. Soil communities are extremely complex (thousands of microbes), spatially heterogenous (influenced by local vegetation, moisture, soil properties, etc), and temporally dynamic (influenced by rainfall, temperature fluctuation, and seasons). A comprehensive characterization of soil communities will require deep -omics analysis on many samples. In this project, we will leverage the sequencing capability of JGI and the mass spectrometry capabilities of EMSL. We are excited to see how we can get a better analysis of organic compounds in soils using a FT-ICR mass spectrometer. This may provide a more accurate environmental context to rationalize the metabolic activities of microbial communities revealed by -omics results.
