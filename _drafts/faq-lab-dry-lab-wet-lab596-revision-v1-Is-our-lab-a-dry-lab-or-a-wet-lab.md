We are a dry lab that develops algorithms to process omics data and mine omics data for biological knowledge. Our algorithms are developed to address real-world needs in our studies, to bridge critical gaps that are not well covered by existing algorithms, or to take advantage of upcoming technologies for new applications. Close connection with our wet lab research provides motivations for new algorithms, ideas for new applications, and deep understanding of the nature of the data.

We are also a wet lab that performs experiments and generates data in proteomics, genomics, transcripteomics and metabolomics. Because sequencing has become a commodity service, we use core facilities that provide the latest technology for small-scale sequencing. We apply for JGI user projects for large-scale sequencing. We share mass spec facilities with Drs. Bob Hettich and Greg Hurst. By pooling our research projects, we can share the cost and burden of instrument maintenance and keep all our mass specs busy nearly 24/7.
