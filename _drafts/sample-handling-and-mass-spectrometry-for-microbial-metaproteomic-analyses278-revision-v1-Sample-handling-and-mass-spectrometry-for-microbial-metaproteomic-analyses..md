**Abstract:** Metaproteomic studies of whole microbial communities from environmental samples (e.g., soil, sediments, freshwater, seawater, etc.) have rapidly increased in recent years due to many technological advances in mass spectrometry (MS). A single 24-h liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) measurement can potentially detect and quantify thousands of proteins from many dominant and subdominant naturally occurring microbial populations. Importantly, amino acid sequences and relative abundance information for detected peptides are determined, which allows for the characterization of expressed protein functions within communities and specific matches to be made to microbial lineages, with potential subspecies resolution. Continued optimization of protein extraction and fractionation protocols, development of quantification methods, and advances in mass spectrometry instrumentation are enabling more accurate and comprehensive peptide detection within samples, leading to wider research applicability, greater ease of use, and overall accessibility. This chapter provides a brief overview of metaproteomics experimental options, including a general protocol for sample handling and LC-MS/MS measurement.
