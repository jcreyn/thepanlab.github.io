We co-purchase and co-support facilities with the [Organic and Biological Mass Spectrometry](http://web.ornl.gov/sci/csd/Research_areas/obms_group.html) group in the Chemical Science Division and the [Comparative Genomics](http://compbio.ornl.gov/) group in the BioScience Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

**The general laboratory facilities** include incubators, sonicators, ultracentrifuges, -80 C freezers, UV-visible absorbance spectrophotometer, chemical hoods, and miscellaneous small laboratory equipments.

**The LC-MS facilities** include four Thermo Finnigan LTQ linear ion<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-562" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OrbiElite-265x300.png" alt="Orbitrap Elite" width="265" height="300" srcset="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OrbiElite-265x300.png 265w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OrbiElite.png 893w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /> trap mass spectrometers and three Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid MSs, including an LTQ Orbitrap XL, an LTQ Orbitrap Velos, and an Orbitrap Elite. Each instrument is interfaced via electrospray with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipment (LC Packings Ultimate HPLC, Switchos flow switching module, FAMOS autosampler, Agilent 1200 series, or Thermo Finnigan Accela) to perform online single- and multi-dimensional separations of complex mixtures of peptides. A Thermo Finnigan TSQ Quantum triple quadrupole MS is dedicated to quantitative measurements of targeted proteins. Three pressure cells for packing and sample loading of custom capillary HPLC columns are available for nano-LC experiments.

**The computing facilities** include an InfiniBand 1056-core cluster and a Panasas file server. The InfiniBand cluster includes four 48-core compute nodes (each with four 12-core AMD Opteron 6172 @ 2.1GHz and 128 GB RAM) and ten 64-core compute node (each with four 16-core AMD Opteron 6376 @ 2.3GHz  and 256 GB RAM). The Panasas file server has 62 TB of storage space. All servers are housed in a 40,000 ft<sup>2</sup> state-of-the-art data center with high-speed network connections.

We obtain **large-scale sequencing allocation** from DOE [Joint Genome Institute](http://jgi.doe.gov/) (JGI) through user proposals. JGI provides integrated high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis that enable systems-based scientific approaches to clean energy generation and environmental characterization and cleanup.
