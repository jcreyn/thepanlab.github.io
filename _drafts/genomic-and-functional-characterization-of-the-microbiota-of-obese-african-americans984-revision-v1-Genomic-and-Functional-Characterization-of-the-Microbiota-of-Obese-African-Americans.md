We won a proposal to study the relationship between obesity and microbiota in African Americans in collaboration with Prof. Hassan Brim at Howard University.

Summary:

The human gut microbiota has been found to play an important role in obesity, since the transformation, absorption, and disposal of nutrients and wastes in the gastrointestinal track depend on its activities. The correlation between obesity and gut microbiota is understudied in African Americans despite their significantly higher obesity rate compared to Caucasian Americans (48% v. 33%). We hypothesize that the community composition and metabolic profiles of the gut microbiota will be different between obese and lean African Americans and that these differences would point to the direction of microbiota signatures that associate with obesity, either in a causative or consequential manner. We expect that key microorganisms or key metabolic functions may either contribute measurably to obesity or reliably reflect conditions that do. Integrated metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic and metabolomic analyses will provide direct assessments of critical bacteria and/or metabolic functions as informative markers of elevated obesity risk with potential translational applications.
