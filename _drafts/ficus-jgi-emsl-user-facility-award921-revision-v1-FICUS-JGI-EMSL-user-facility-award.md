A user proposal from Melanie Mayes and us has been selected by JGI and EMSL in [the FICUS user program](https://jgi.doe.gov/user-program-info/community-science-program/how-to-propose-a-csp-project/emsl/). The title of our proposal is &#8220;Linking proteogenomics, metabolomics, and soil organic chemistry of tropical wetlands to a soil nutrient cycling model&#8221;. We are very excited to start this project with JGI and EMSL.
