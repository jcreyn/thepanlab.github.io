#### Overall goals of the study:

Tropical wetlands are a significant source of methane and CO2 emissions. However, it is unknown how climate changes may perturb tropical wetland ecosystems and alter their carbon cycling. The goal of this project is to characterize the metabolic activities of soil microbial communities in a wetland ecosystem located in San San Pond Sak, Panama. This site is accessible with the assistance of the field station of Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Bocas del Toro. This wetland ecosystem has been described in Sjorgersten et al. 2011. In our study, soil communities will be measured with metagenomics and metatranscriptomics at the molecular level and correlate the -omics results with soil chemical properties, organic matter compositions, and incubation  emissions. We will in particular focus on the redux reactions in the wetland soils under different conditions. The results will be used to improve the Earth System models for tropical wetlands.

#### Technical objectives of the field trip:

Replicate soil samples will be collected from a depth of ~10 cm from  sites along a transect of the wetland.

  * Site 1: Raphia taedigera swamp
  * Site 2: mixed species forest swamp
  * Site 3: Campnosperma panamensis forest swamp
  * Site 4 stunted Campnosperma panamensis forest with a Cyperus sp.Sawgrass understorey
  * Site 5 Sawgrass Cyperus sp. Swamp with occasional stunted Campnosperma panamensis

#### Field sampling team:

  * Melanie Mayes (ORNL)
  * Chongle Pan (ORNL)
  * Eric Brown (STRI)

#### Bocas del Toro:

The field station of STRI is located in the north of the Bocas town in the south peninsula of the Bocas del Tora province.  The STRI field station provided a boat, the lodging, and lab space for us. Our plan was to collect the samples from the wetland during the day and return to the field station  in the evening to process the samples in the lab.

To our pleasant surprise, the Bocas town is actually a tourist destination, which made our logistics much easier. Below is a picture of the streets from the airplane as we were landing. Many of these buildings are restaurants, grocery stores, and hotels for tourists. The yellow pickup truck is a cab. These cabs are very easy to catch on the streets with a low fare. We replied on these cabs to go around the Bocas town to eat and buy supplies.

The tourists&#8217; attractions include snorkeling in crystal clear water, taking boat rides into the ocean, the beaches, and the forests.

#### San San Pond Sak

As soon as the day broke, we collected our sampling equipments and took a boat to get to the sampling site. This is a picture of the dock from the STRI field station. We used one of the small boats like those:

[<img class="size-large wp-image-1187" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dock-1024x578.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="361" srcset="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dock-1024x578.jpg 1024w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dock-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dock-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dock-479x270.jpg 479w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dock.jpg)

A view from the boat on our way across the ocean to the sampling site:

[<img class="size-large wp-image-1188" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boat-ocean-view-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boat-ocean-view-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boat-ocean-view-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boat-ocean-view-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boat-ocean-view-360x270.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/boat-ocean-view.jpg)

As shown on the map, the sampling sites are actually located very inland in the wetland. After across the ocean, we need to go through a small channel to get to the trail head to the sampling site. The entry to the channel are blocked by sand dune. It was very important that we arrive there during the high tide such that the water over the sand dune is still deep enough for our boat. During our trip, Eric actually had to jump off and push the boat over the sand dune. This was actually risky because of the possibility of stings by jellyfish or other organisms in water.

Below is a picture of the channel. This channel was originally dug out for farmers to transport their bananas out of the plantation deep inland. It&#8217;s still used by farmers and fishermen. Eric told us there are many alligators hidden in the channel. They are hidden very well during the day, but during night, the headlight of the boat often lights up the eyes of many alligators because of the reflection.

[<img class="size-large wp-image-1189" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/channel-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/channel-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/channel-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/channel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/channel-360x270.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/channel.jpg)

#### The hiking

We need to hike about 0.5 miles from the hail head off the channel to Site 1. Below is a picture of the trail head. Eric is probably the only one who can find this trail head.

[<img class="size-large wp-image-1190" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trail-head-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trail-head-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trail-head-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trail-head-203x270.jpg 203w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/trail-head.jpg)

Hiking through a tropical wetland is the most fun part of this trip. Once off the boat, there was not more firm ground to stand on. Every step is basically a step into mud as deep as the calf. Stepping one leg into the mud is the easy part (just let it sink), but pulling the other leg out of the mud is the hard part.

Between site 1 and site 2, there is a small lake that we need to cross. In the last time, they strung a rope across the lake between two trees and step through on the rope. In this time, Eric built a makeshift bridge with branches. It took delicate balancing to cross the bridge without falling into water.

#### The sampling

We used a Russian peat borer to collect soil samples. First, we found a spot to push the borer into the soil.

[<img class="size-large wp-image-1192 alignnone" src="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sampling-corer-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sampling-corer-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sampling-corer-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sampling-corer-203x270.jpg 203w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />](https://www.omicsbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/sampling-corer.jpg)

Then, we need to twist the borer. The blade rotates laterally and scoop up soils. Next, the borer was pulled out.
